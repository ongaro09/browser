## Search for Elements

Here's the [document](https://github.com/ongaro09/browser/blob/main/chapter-one_document/04-searching/00-index.html) with the table and form.

How to find?

1. The table with `"id=age-table"`.
2. All label elements inside that table.
3. The first `td` in that table (with the word "Age");
4. The `form` with `"name=search"`.
5. The first `input` in that form.
6. The last `input` in that form.
