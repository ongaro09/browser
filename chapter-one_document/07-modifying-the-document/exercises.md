## Task 1

Write an interface to create a list from user input.

For every list item: 
1. Ask a user about list item using `prompt`.
2. Create the `<li>` with it and add to `<ul>`.
3. Continue until the user cancels the input (By pressing `Esc` or via an empty entry).

All elements must be created dynamically.

If a user types HTML-tags, they should be treated like a text.
