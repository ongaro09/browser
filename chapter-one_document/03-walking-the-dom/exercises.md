# Tasks

The following tasks are sourced from this [link](https://javascript.info/dom-navigation).

## DOM Children

Look at this page:

```
<html>
<body>
  <div>Developers:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Ongaro</li>
	<li>Mukami</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>

```

For each of the following, give at least one way of how to access them:
- The `<div>` DOM node?
- The `<ul>` DOM node?
- The second `<li>` `(with Mukami)`
